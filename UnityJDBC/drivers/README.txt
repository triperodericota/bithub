INSTALLATION
------------
Copy the appropriate JAR file(s) into a directory that is in your CLASSPATH.

An easy method to do this is to put the files in your ext directory of your JDK and JRE installation.
e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8\jre\lib\ext

When running SourceBuilder, any JARs in the lib folder are also in the CLASSPATH.
